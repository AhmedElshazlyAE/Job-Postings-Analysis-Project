# üìàThe Analysis
Each Query In this project is aimed at providing Data Analysts with
information about the job market. Here is how I approached each 
question

### Top Paying data-analyst jobs
To show the highest paying roles I filtered each job by it's
average yearly salary then Ordered them descendingly to identify
which jobs pay the most

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    salary_year_avg
    
FROM job_postings_fact

WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC --Ordering by yearly salary 

LIMIT 10
```

FROM job_postings_fact

WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10
)


SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.job_title,
    skills_jobs_combined.skill_id,
    skills_jobs_combined.skills

FROM top_paying_jobs

--Joining the skills_dim and skills_job_dim in a single table
--Not necessary just trying to play around with subqueries
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        skills_job_dim.job_id,
        skills_dim.skills

    FROM skills_job_dim

    LEFT JOIN skills_dim

    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id

# üí° What I Learned
1. The project helped me advance my SQL and Power BI capabilities by practically exploring and visualizing data. I learned to:
Compose complex SQL queries to join tables, aggregate data, and arrive at important insights from job market datasets.

2. Determine high-paying and in-demand skills for data analysts through real job postings.

3. Design clear and insightful Power BI visuals like cluster bar charts and area plots to tell data in a narrative.

4. Make conclusions from data insights and turn them into real-life takeaways that could be employed to guide career decisions.

5. Use data analysis not just to report facts, but to give actual answers‚Äîsuch as what to learn and why.

6. This was also my first experience building a data storytelling project in Power BI from the ground up, and it taught me so much more about how data pipelines can be combined with business intelligence tools.

# ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project was a valuable step on my journey towards being a data analyst. Combining SQL and Power BI, I was able to dive into real job market statistics and find interesting facts about the best skills when it comes to salary and demand. The analysis showed that tools like Python and SQL are still the tops when it comes to salary and hiring demand, and Tableau, PowerBI and Excel proficiency are still just as vital.

Beyond the production of visuals, this project allowed me to think critically with data‚Äîhow to take raw information and convert it into something that helps solve important questions. It also gave me more assurance with Power BI as a tool for analysis and storytelling.

I am excited to continue using these skills in future projects and further developing my data science and analytics capabilities.
